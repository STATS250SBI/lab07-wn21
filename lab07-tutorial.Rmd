# Lab Tutorial

This week, we're going to talk about the *normal distribution*. A "distribution" refers to the possible values a random variable can take as well as the probability that it takes those values. It is commonly used to approximate all sorts of things in nature and life.

Let's take a look at the normal distribution.

![](assets/normal-distributions.png)

It takes two numbers to describe a normal distribution: the **mean** and **standard deviation**. The way we describe a normal distribution is N(mu, sigma), where mu is the population mean and sigma is the population standard deviation. Normal distributions are all bell-shaped, unimodal, and symmetric, regardless of the mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$). The mean $\mu$ specifies the *center* of the distribution. The standard deviation $\sigma$ specifies the *variability* of the distribution (meaning, how narrow or wide is it?).

## Probability with Normal Distributions

The birth weight of newborn babies in Wales is normally-distributed with a mean of 3.39 kg (7.47 lbs)and a standard deviation of 0.55kg (1.21lbs).^[https://www.healthknowledge.org.uk/public-health-textbook/research-methods/1b-statistical-methods/statistical-distributions]

If something has a normal distribution, the probability of that thing taking on a particular range of values is the area under the normal curve between those values. Let's find the probability that a baby in Wales will weigh less than 3 kg (6.61 lbs).

To draw the area that corresponds to this probability, use a function we wrote called `plot_norm()`. 

```{r plot1}
plot_norm(mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55, shadeValues = 3, direction = "less")
```

To make this diagram, we're using a function we built for you called `plotNorm()`. You pass `plotNorm()` the following arguments:

- `mean`: the mean of the normal distribution you'd like to draw ($\mu$)
- `sd`: the standard deviation of the normal distribution you'd like to draw ($\sigma$)
- `shadeValues` (optional): either a number or a vector of two numbers (using `c()`) that are the boundaries of the region you'd like to shade.
- `direction`: where to shade (`"less"`, `"greater"`, `"inside"`, or `"outside"`)
- `col.shade`: the color to use when shading
- any other graphical parameters you want to use to control the appearance of the plot (like `main`, etc.)

To find the area of the blue shaded region, we'll use the `pnorm()` function (`p` stands for `p`robability):

```{r pnormExample1}
pnorm(q = 3, mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55)
```

We expect that about 23.9% of Welsh babies will weigh less than 3 kg at birth.

We can also find the probability of a Welsh baby having a birth weight of 3.5 kg or greater. First, we'll draw the plot. Notice that we're setting `direction = "greater"` now.

```{r plot2}
plot_norm(mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55, shadeValues = 3.5, 
          direction = "greater", 
          col.shade = "peachpuff")
```

There are two ways we can deal with the fact that we're now shading "up" (to the right):

1. Use the fact that the total area under the normal curve is 1
2. Use the `lower.tail` argument to `pnorm()` and set it to `FALSE`.

```{r pnormExampleUp}
1 - pnorm(3.5, mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55)
pnorm(3.5, mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Now, let's find the probability that a baby born in Wales weighs between 3 and 3.5 kg. Start by drawing the figure:

```{r plot3}
plot_norm(mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55, 
          shadeValues = c(3, 3.5), 
          direction = "between", 
          col.shade = "forestgreen")
```

Here, we need to find the probability by using `pnorm()` twice -- first to find the area to the left of 3.5, then again to find the area to the left of 3.0 -- and subtracting.

![](assets/area-subtraction.png)

```{r pnormSubtract}
pnorm(q = 3.5, mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55) - pnorm(q = 3, mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55)
```

Let's demonstrate the last direction we can use in `plot_norm()`: `direction = "beyond"`. Say we want to find the probability that a Welsh baby is born weighing *EITHER* less than 3 kg *OR* more than 4 kg.

```{r plot4}
plot_norm(mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55, 
          shadeValues = c(3, 4), 
          direction = "beyond", 
          col.shade = "maroon2")
```

To find this probability, we'll just add up the area in each tail:

```{r beyondProb}
pnorm(q = 3, mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55) + pnorm(4, mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

## Normal Quantiles

Quantiles are cut points of a distribution that divides the distribution into equal areas. For example, the median divides a distribution into 2 equal AREAS, and quartiles divide a distribution into 4 equal AREAS.

The `q` argument in `pnorm()` stands for `q`uantile. `pnorm()` gives us the area to the left (if `lower.tail = TRUE`) of `q`. Given a number `p` between 0 and 1, we can use `qnorm()` to find the quantile `q` that will have `p` area to the left or right of that number. We say that `q` is the "`p`th quantile of the N($\mu$, $\sigma$) distribution".

We saw above that the area to the left of 3.0 in a N(3.39, 0.55) distribution is 0.239. Let's use this to demonstrate the use of `qnorm()`:

```{r, qnormLeft}
qnorm(p = 0.239, mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55)
```

So we can see that `qnorm()` is the opposite of `pnorm`, in the way that division is the opposite of multiplication: one undoes the other. 

We can also use `lower.tail = FALSE` inside `qnorm()` to find the (1-`p`)th quantile (the number such that there is 1-`p` area to the left and `p` area to the right):

```{r, qnormRight}
qnorm(p = 0.421, mean = 3.39, sd = 0.55, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

**NOTE**: you can't use `1-qnorm(p)` instead of setting `lower.tail = FALSE` since the normal distribution extends to all real numbers (negative infinity to positive infinity). 

# Code Cheat Sheet

## `pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)`
- **`q`** refers to the value you want to find the area above or below
  - `pnorm(q, 0, 1)` gives $P(Z < q)$ where $Z$ is $N(0,1)$
- **`mean`** refers to $\mu$, defaults to 0
- **`sd`** refers to $\sigma$, defaults to 1
- **`lower.tail`** controls which direction to "shade": `lower.tail = TRUE` goes less than `q`, `lower.tail = FALSE` goes greater than `q`; defaults to `TRUE`

## `qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)`
- **`p`** refers to the area under the curve
  - `qnorm(p, 0, 1)` is the number such that the area to the left of it is `p`
- **`mean`** refers to $\mu$, defaults to 0
- **`sd`** refers to $\sigma$, defaults to 1
- **`lower.tail`** controls which direction to "shade": `lower.tail = TRUE` goes less than `q`, `lower.tail = FALSE` goes greater than `q`; defaults to `TRUE`

## `plot_norm(mean = 0, sd = 1, shadeValues, direction, col.shade, ...)`
- **`mean`** refers to $\mu$, defaults to 0
- **`sd`** refers to $\sigma$, defaults to 1
- **`shadeValues`** is a vector of up to 2 numbers that define the region you want to shade
- **`direction`** can be one of `less`, `greater`, `between`, or `beyond`, and controls the direction of shading between `shadeValues`. Must be `less` or `greater` if `shadeValues` has only one element; `between` or `beyond` if two
- **`col.shade`** controls the color of the shaded region, defaults to `"cornflowerblue"`
- **`...`** lets you specify other graphical parameters to control the appearance of the normal curve (e.g., `lwd`, `lty`, `col`, etc.)
